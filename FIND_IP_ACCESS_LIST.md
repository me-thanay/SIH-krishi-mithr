# Find IP Access List in Database & Network Access

## You're in the Right Place! ✅

You're currently on **"Database & Network Access"** under the **SECURITY** section. This is correct!

## What to Look For:

On the **"Database & Network Access"** page, you should see:

### Option 1: Tabs at the Top
Look for **tabs** at the top of the main content area:
- **"Database Users"** tab (you're probably on this one)
- **"Network Access"** tab OR **"IP Access List"** tab

**Action:** Click on the **"Network Access"** or **"IP Access List"** tab

### Option 2: Sub-sections/Sidebar
Look for a **sub-menu** or **sub-sections** on the left or top:
- Database Users
- Network Access / IP Access List

**Action:** Click on **"Network Access"** or **"IP Access List"**

### Option 3: Direct Link
If you see tabs, the URL should change when you click. Try:
```
https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/security/network/list
```

## What You Should See:

Once you're on the **Network Access / IP Access List** page, you'll see:
- A table/list of IP addresses
- A button like **"+ ADD IP ADDRESS"** or **"+ ADD ENTRY"**
- Current entries (might be empty or have some IPs)

## What to Do:

1. **Look for the "Network Access" or "IP Access List" tab** (usually at the top)
2. **Click it** to switch from "Database Users" to "Network Access"
3. **Check if `0.0.0.0/0` is in the list**
4. **If not, click "+ ADD IP ADDRESS"** and select **"ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE"**

## Quick Check:

On your current "Database & Network Access" page, what do you see at the **top**? 
- Are there tabs?
- What are the tab names?
- Or do you see any buttons or sections related to "Network" or "IP"?
