# How to Find Network Access in MongoDB Atlas

## Alternative Names/Locations:

The Network Access/IP Whitelist might be under different names:

### Option 1: Look for "Security" Section
- In the left sidebar, look for **"SECURITY"** or **"Security"**
- Under Security, you might see:
  - **"Network Access"**
  - **"IP Access List"**
  - **"IP Whitelist"**

### Option 2: Look for "Access Control"
- Some MongoDB Atlas interfaces show **"Access Control"**
- Under Access Control:
  - **"Network Access"**
  - **"IP Access List"**

### Option 3: Check the Top Navigation
- Look at the **top navigation bar**
- You might see tabs like:
  - **"Security"** → Click it → Then "Network Access"
  - **"Access Control"** → Click it → Then "IP Access List"

### Option 4: Search in Sidebar
- Scroll through the **entire left sidebar**
- Look for any section that mentions:
  - "Network"
  - "IP"
  - "Access"
  - "Security"
  - "Whitelist"

### Option 5: Direct URL
Try going directly to:
```
https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/security/network/list
```

Or:
1. Go to your cluster
2. Click **"Connect"** button
3. Look for **"Network Access"** or **"IP Whitelist"** in the connection setup

## What You're Looking For:

You need to find a page that shows:
- A list of IP addresses
- A button to **"Add IP Address"** or **"Add Entry"**
- Option to allow **"0.0.0.0/0"** (all IPs)
