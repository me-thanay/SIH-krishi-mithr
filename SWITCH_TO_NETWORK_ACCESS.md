# Switch to Network Access Tab

## Current Status:
You're on the **"Database Users"** tab within "Database & Network Access". ✅

## What to Do:

### Look for Tabs Near the Title

1. **Look at the top of the main content area**, near where it says **"Database Users"**
2. You should see **tabs** like:
   - **"Database Users"** (currently selected/highlighted)
   - **"Network Access"** or **"IP Access List"** (click this one!)

### Alternative: Look for a Dropdown or Menu

If you don't see tabs, look for:
- A **dropdown menu** near "Database Users"
- A **button** or **link** that says "Network Access"
- **Sub-navigation** items

### What to Click:

Click on **"Network Access"** or **"IP Access List"** tab/button

## After Clicking Network Access:

You should see:
- A page titled **"Network Access"** or **"IP Access List"**
- A list/table of IP addresses (might be empty)
- A button like **"+ ADD IP ADDRESS"** or **"+ ADD ENTRY"**

## Visual Guide:

The tabs are usually located:
- **Right above or below** the "Database Users" title
- **At the top** of the white content area
- Sometimes as **horizontal tabs** that look like buttons
